# Reporting Security Issues

If you found a security vulnerability, you deserve all the credit.
Please feel free to have a good ROFLMAO over my broken design.
I deserve all the blame and I have all the responsibility for fixing the problem.

I'd like to ask you to fully disclose the details of your valuable findings via GitHub Security Advisory [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/mbuesch/letmein/security/advisories/new) tab or report it privately via [security@bues.ch] to me.

If you found a severe security vulnerability, a private disclosue is preferred.
This is to protect our users from [0-Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_vulnerability) exploits.
I will always publish vulnerabilities to the public after finding a proper fix.
